    # When your component is specified on the commandline, POX automatically
    # calls this function.

    # Add whatever parameters you want to this.  They will become
    # commandline arguments.  You can specify default values or not.
    # In this example, foo is required and bar is not.  You may also
    # specify a keyword arguments catch-all (e.g., **kwargs).

    # For example, you can execute this component as:
    # ./pox.py skeleton --foo=3 --bar=4

    # Note that arguments passed from the commandline are ordinarily
    # always strings, and it's up to you to validate and convert them.
    # The one exception is if a user specifies the parameter name but no
    # value (e.g., just "--foo").  In this case, it receives the actual
    # Python value True.
    # The @pox.util.eval_args decorator interprets them as if they are
    # Python literals.  Even things like --foo=[1,2,3] behave as expected.
    # Things that don't appear to be Python literals are left as strings.

    # If you want to be able to invoke the component multiple times, add
    # __INSTANCE__=None as the last parameter.  When multiply-invoked, it
    # will be passed a tuple with the following:
    # 1. The number of this instance (0...n-1)
    # 2. The total number of instances for this module
    # 3. True if this is the last instance, False otherwise
    # The last is just a comparison between #1 and #2, but is convenient.

    # log.warn("uri: %s (%s)", uri, type(uri))
    # log.warn("username: %s (%s)", username, type(username))
    # log.warn("password: %s (%s)", password, type(password))
